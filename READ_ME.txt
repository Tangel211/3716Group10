The first iterative update will add dating info to the timeslot table, set up a print function for the timeslot table, make the table interactive (clicking a slot provides information regarding the selection), update interface apperance.

Iteration 2:

The second iterative update will add a feature that saves previous timeslot data, the ability to let the system automatically enter recursive requests, a priority system based on the time of year and overall use time, updated login system for principle, requestee, and student.


Group 10's application provided a framework for the space assignment school app, our developments allow the user to log in. Based on which type of user they log in as, they have different options available. The principal can view a editable version of the calender, the requestee can submit info for a request which the app submits into a file called requests.txt . The student can only view the calender
